## Ideal requirements

A custom solution for HDA's graphic production needs should preferably include the following:

* Ability to manage and use at least two brand palettes for data visualization
    + [HDA palette](colors-hda.qmd)
    + [HFV palette](colors-hfv.qmd)
* Pre-made color scales
    + Categorical (up to 6 variables)
    + Sequential (several color options)
    + Diverging (at least 2 options)
* Standard chart layout(s) using pre-defined `theme()` options in `ggplot2`
    + Label formatting (title, subtitle, axes, caption)
    + Layout formatting (axis lines, axis labels, gridlines, ticks, legends, etc.)
* Ability to load and use custom fonts via Google Fonts
    + [HDA fonts](fonts-hda.qmd)
    + [HFV fonts](fonts-hfv.qmd)
* Pre-assigned variable colors (example variable lists below)

| Race/ethnicity      | Tenure    | Housing type    |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------------|
| White, non-Hispanic | Homeowner | Single-family   |
| Black               | Renter    | Duplex          |
| Hispanic or Latino  |           | 3-4 units       |
| Asian               |           | 5 or more units |
| Multiracial         |           |                 |
| Another race        |           |                 |

* Standard export settings that produce legible graphics for Quarto/RMarkdown outputs
    + HTML (book and website options)
    + HTML (`revealjs` presentations)^[Because these HTML slides are rendered/displayed at a higher resolution (full screen) than the HTML book and website options, the default base size for text and other elements can be too small to read when presenting on a projection screen in-person.]
    + PDF (whichever PDF render engine is best)

## Style

The Urban Institute "chart parts" is the best starting point to build HDA's own chart setup.
