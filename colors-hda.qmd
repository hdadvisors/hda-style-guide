## Primary palette

HDAdvisors uses a four-color palette.

```{r}

library(scales)
library(chroma)

pal <- c(
  "#445ca9", # Blue
  "#8baeaa", # Green
  "#e9ab3f", # Yellow
  "#e76f52"  # Coral
  )

scales::show_col(pal, borders = "#ffffff")

```

::: {.callout-note}

We've asked our marketing consultant to provide two additional colors for this palette. This would allow for categorical color schemes for data with more than four variables.
